# Credit Risk Analysis and Optimization Project

## Overview
This project involves an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the German Credit dataset aimed at understanding creditworthiness determinants. The objective is to minimize risk and maximize profitability for a bank by scrutinizing applicant profiles.

## Responsibilities
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and conducted advanced imputation techniques (KNN imputation).
- **EDA:** Explored distributions, correlations, and patterns among features. Investigated demographic and socio-economic factors impacting credit decisions.
- **Analysis by Group:** Segmented data for gender, age groups, and job classifications. Examined credit distributions and loan purposes within each group.
- **Visualization:** Utilized various plots (histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps) to illustrate relationships and uncover insights.
- **Insights and Observations:** Identified significant trends such as preferred loan types, credit distribution patterns, and employment factors influencing credit decisions.

## Methodologies Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored relationships, distributions, and correlations to derive meaningful insights.
- **Data Cleaning Techniques:** Addressed missing values, erroneous entries, and categorical encoding.
- **Visualization:** Leveraged visualizations (histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps) to present key findings effectively.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilized correlation matrices and statistical summaries to uncover relationships.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Missing Values Handling:** Managed significant missing data in 'Saving Accounts' and 'Checking Account' columns by employing KNN imputation.
- **Categorical Data Encoding:** Encoded categorical variables and created new categories to facilitate analysis.
- **Visualization Complexity:** Managed to present multifaceted insights through clean and informative visualizations.

## Achievements and Insights
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identified correlations between credit duration and amount, enabling strategies to minimize risks.
- **Applicant Behavior Analysis:** Uncovered gender-specific preferences in loan types and credit distribution.
- **Job Classifications Impact:** Discovered credit amount disparities among job classifications.
